# Scaffolding

Scripts and templates we use to enforce standards and get a running start. These require
[Google ZX][1] and can be installed with:

```
npm install -g zx
```

You can use the scaffolding like this:

```
zx https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OneSheep/scaffolding/main/flutter/init.mjs
```
